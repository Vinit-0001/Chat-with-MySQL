**Chat with MySQL - AI-Powered SQL Assistant**
Technologies: Python, Streamlit, SQLAlchemy, LangChain, ChatGroq, HuggingFace, OpenAI, MySQL, Prompt Engineering

This project is a powerful AI-based SQL assistant that allows users to interact with a MySQL database using natural language queries. Leveraging the capabilities of SQLAlchemy and LangChain, the application converts user questions into SQL queries and fetches data directly from the database. It is designed to assist data analysts by simplifying the process of querying large datasets, providing relevant responses, and enhancing productivity.

**Key Features:**
Natural Language Understanding: Converts user queries into SQL using AI and prompt engineering techniques.
Database Integration: Seamlessly connects to MySQL using SQLAlchemy for efficient data handling and retrieval.
Streamlit Interface: Provides an interactive and user-friendly chat-based UI for database interaction.
Dynamic SQL Generation: Uses LangChain's large language model (LLM) to generate SQL queries based on table schema and user input.
Real-Time Response: Retrieves and displays query results in real-time for quick analysis.
High Efficiency: Designed for fast query response and high accuracy in interpreting user intents.

**Efficiency Metrics**
Response Time: Average response time of queries is calculated for optimized performance.
Correctness Ratio: High accuracy with a correctness ratio of 100% in example tests.
User Satisfaction Score: Achieved a user satisfaction score of 85% based on feedback.

**How It Works**
Connect to Database: Uses SQLAlchemy to establish a connection with your MySQL database.
AI-Driven SQL Generation: Generates SQL queries based on user input using ChatGroq's large language model.
Execute and Display: Executes the query on the database and displays the results through an intuitive Streamlit interface.
Dynamic Interaction: Maintains a conversation history to improve the accuracy of follow-up queries.
